# Notification App Pattern


Security Features of the API

Security features implemented:

TLS encryption (HTTPS) is enforced by API Gateway

API Key authentication

HSTS header implementation

Input validation and sanitization

Error handling and logging

Secure response headers

Rate limiting (configured in API Gateway)

This Lambda.py code implements a serverless notification service using AWS Lambda that can send three types of notifications: SMS, email, and push notifications. Let me break it down into digestible parts:

Overall Structure The code is organized into a NotificationService class that handles different types of notifications, and a lambda_handler function that processes incoming HTTP requests.

Main Components :

NotificationService Class

Initializes an SNS (Simple Notification Service) client

Has methods for sending different types of notifications:

send_sms: Sends text messages

send_email: Sends emails

send_push: Sends push notifications to mobile devices

Request Handling

Expects POST requests with JSON body

Validates incoming requests for required fields

Routes notifications based on the 'type' field

How It Works (like a post office with different delivery methods):

// Example request:
{
    "type": "sms",
    "message": "Hello there!",
    "phone_number": "+1234567890"
}

Copy

Insert at cursor
json
When this request arrives:

The Lambda function checks if it's a POST request

Validates the JSON structure

Based on the "type", it calls the appropriate sending method

Returns a success or error response

Error Handling The code includes comprehensive error handling for:

Invalid requests

Missing fields

AWS service errors

General unexpected errors

Security Features

Includes security headers (HSTS)

Validates input data

Uses environment variables for sensitive information

Logs errors for monitoring

Think of it like a universal messaging center that can:

Send text messages (like a phone)

Send emails (like an email client)

Send push notifications (like app notifications on your phone)

All through one unified interface, similar to how a post office can send letters, packages, or express mail through one counter.



Testing the API

SMS

{
    "type": "sms",
    "phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "message": "Your secure SMS notification"
}


Email

{
    "type": "email",
    "email": "recipient@example.com",
    "subject": "Secure Notification",
    "message": "Your secure email notification"
}


Push

{
    "type": "push",
    "endpoint_arn": "arn:aws:sns:region:account:endpoint/platform/device-token",
    "title": "Secure Notification",
    "message": "Your secure push notification"
}
